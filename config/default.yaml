# Default Restyler Configuration
#
# Overall notes:
#
# - All keys are optional and default as shown
# - The entire config can also be just a list of values, which will be
#   interpreted as specifying the restylers key
#
####

# Do anything at all?
enabled: true

# Push the style fixes directly to the original PR
#
# This setting implies pull_requests: false for origin PRs, and has no effect on
# forked PRs (since we can't push to those).
#
auto: false

# Download remote files before restyling
#
# Example:
#
#   remote_files:
#     - url: https://raw.github.com/.../hlint.yaml
#       path: .hlint.yaml
#
# Files must be publicly accessible.
#
remote_files: []

# Open Restyle PRs?
pull_requests: true

# Leave comments on the original PR linking to the Restyle PR?
comments: true

# Set commit statuses on the original PR?
statuses:
  # Red status in the case of differences found
  differences: true
  # Green status in the case of no differences found
  no_differences: true
  # Red status if we encounter errors restyling
  error: true

# Request review on the Restyle PR?
#
# Possible values:
#
#   author: From the author of the original PR
#   owner: From the owner of the repository
#
# One value will apply to origin and forked PRs, but you can also specify
# separate values.
#
request_review: none

# Add labels to any created Restyle PRs
#
# These can be used to tell other automation to avoid our PRs.
#
labels: []

# Which restylers to run
#
# See restyled-io/restylers repository for their defaults.
#
restylers:
  - astyle
  - autopep8
  - elm-format
  - php-cs-fixer
  - prettier
  - rubocop
  - rustfmt
  - shfmt
  - stylish-haskell
  - terraform

# Version of the set of Restylers to run
#
# This should correspond to a ref on the restyled-io/restylers repository,
# usually it's a tag that is a date of when that set was released. You could
# re-specific the default in your own config if you prefer to avoid update
# surprises.
#
restylers_version: "20190627"
