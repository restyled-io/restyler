--   Additional types of channels for STM.
@package stm-chans
@version 3.0.0.4


-- | A version of <a>Control.Concurrent.STM.TChan</a> where the queue is
--   bounded in length. This variant incorporates ideas from Thomas M.
--   DuBuisson's <tt>bounded-tchan</tt> package in order to reduce
--   contention between readers and writers.
module Control.Concurrent.STM.TBChan

-- | <tt>TBChan</tt> is an abstract type representing a bounded FIFO
--   channel.
data TBChan a

-- | Build and returns a new instance of <tt>TBChan</tt> with the given
--   capacity. <i>N.B.</i>, we do not verify the capacity is positive, but
--   if it is non-positive then <a>writeTBChan</a> will always retry and
--   <a>isFullTBChan</a> will always be true.
newTBChan :: Int -> STM (TBChan a)

-- | <tt>IO</tt> version of <a>newTBChan</a>. This is useful for creating
--   top-level <tt>TBChan</tt>s using <a>unsafePerformIO</a>, because using
--   <a>atomically</a> inside <a>unsafePerformIO</a> isn't possible.
newTBChanIO :: Int -> IO (TBChan a)

-- | Read the next value from the <tt>TBChan</tt>, retrying if the channel
--   is empty.
readTBChan :: TBChan a -> STM a

-- | A version of <a>readTBChan</a> which does not retry. Instead it
--   returns <tt>Nothing</tt> if no value is available.
tryReadTBChan :: TBChan a -> STM (Maybe a)

-- | Get the next value from the <tt>TBChan</tt> without removing it,
--   retrying if the channel is empty.
peekTBChan :: TBChan a -> STM a

-- | A version of <a>peekTBChan</a> which does not retry. Instead it
--   returns <tt>Nothing</tt> if no value is available.
tryPeekTBChan :: TBChan a -> STM (Maybe a)

-- | Write a value to a <tt>TBChan</tt>, retrying if the channel is full.
writeTBChan :: TBChan a -> a -> STM ()

-- | A version of <a>writeTBChan</a> which does not retry. Returns
--   <tt>True</tt> if the value was successfully written, and
--   <tt>False</tt> otherwise.
tryWriteTBChan :: TBChan a -> a -> STM Bool

-- | Put a data item back onto a channel, where it will be the next item
--   read. <i>N.B.</i>, this could allow the channel to temporarily become
--   longer than the specified limit, which is necessary to ensure that the
--   item is indeed the next one read.
unGetTBChan :: TBChan a -> a -> STM ()

-- | Returns <tt>True</tt> if the supplied <tt>TBChan</tt> is empty (i.e.,
--   has no elements). <i>N.B.</i>, a <tt>TBChan</tt> can be both
--   `<tt>empty'</tt> and `<tt>full'</tt> at the same time, if the initial
--   limit was non-positive.
isEmptyTBChan :: TBChan a -> STM Bool

-- | Returns <tt>True</tt> if the supplied <tt>TBChan</tt> is full (i.e.,
--   is over its limit). <i>N.B.</i>, a <tt>TBChan</tt> can be both
--   `<tt>empty'</tt> and `<tt>full'</tt> at the same time, if the initial
--   limit was non-positive. <i>N.B.</i>, a <tt>TBChan</tt> may still be
--   full after reading, if <a>unGetTBChan</a> was used to go over the
--   initial limit.
--   
--   This is equivalent to: <tt>liftM (&lt;= 0)
--   estimateFreeSlotsTBMChan</tt>
isFullTBChan :: TBChan a -> STM Bool

-- | Estimate the number of free slots. If the result is positive, then
--   it's a minimum bound; if it's non-positive then it's exact. It will
--   only be negative if the initial limit was negative or if
--   <a>unGetTBChan</a> was used to go over the initial limit.
--   
--   This function always contends with writers, but only contends with
--   readers when it has to; compare against <a>freeSlotsTBChan</a>.
estimateFreeSlotsTBChan :: TBChan a -> STM Int

-- | Return the exact number of free slots. The result can be negative if
--   the initial limit was negative or if <a>unGetTBChan</a> was used to go

--   
--   This function always contends with both readers and writers; compare
--   against <a>estimateFreeSlotsTBChan</a>.

writeTBMChan :: TBMChan a -> a -> STM ()

-- | A version of <a>writeTBMChan</a> which does not retry. Returns

tryWriteTBMChan :: TBMChan a -> a -> STM (Maybe Bool)

-- | Put a data item back onto a channel, where it will be the next item
