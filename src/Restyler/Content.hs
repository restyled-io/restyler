the style fixes.

**NOTE**: As work continues on the original Pull Request, this process will
re-run and update (force-push) this Pull Request with updated style fixes as
necessary. If the style is fixed manually at any point (i.e. this process finds
no fixes to make), this Pull Request will be closed automatically.

Sorry if this was unexpected. To disable it, see our [documentation][].
