Hi there!

I just wanted to let you know that some code in this PR might not match the
team's preferred styles. This process isn't perfect, but when we ran some
auto-reformatting tools on it there were differences. Those differences can be
seen in ##{pullRequestNumber pullRequest}.

#{commentCTA pullRequest}

Thanks,
[Restyled.io][]

Your PR was opened from a fork, so we're unable to open our PR with yours as the
base branch. Therefore, the PR linked above was opened directly against
`#{bBranch}`. It includes your changes and another commit to adjust styling.

If you're interested in incorporating the style changes in your PR, you can do
that locally with something like:

```console
git remote add upstream #{pullRequestRepoURL pullRequest}
git fetch upstream pull/#{pullRequestNumber pullRequest}/head
git merge --ff-only FETCH_HEAD
git push
```
|]
    | otherwise = [st|
To incorporate the changes, merge that PR into yours.

Sorry if this was unexpected. To disable it, see our [documentation].
