# Restyler

The restyling process, as a CLI.

## Usage

```console
docker run --rm \
  --env "GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<access-token>" \
  --volume /tmp:tmp \
  --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  restyled/restyler "<owner>/<name>#<number>"
```

**NOTE**: The Access Token you use will determine some of the resulting
behavior. In production, we use a token provisioned for an installed instance of
our GitHub App, which ensures the restyled PRs and comments appear as authored
by our App. If you use a Personal Access Token, the restyled PRs and comments
will be authored by your user.

## Development

just
